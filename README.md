Simple Tool Suite or STS is a simple plugin based app launcher for simple apps or scripts.

# App List:
## Simple Music Genre Analyzer (SMGA)
  - A simple program where you feed it your music library and it will tell you a percentage based distrobution of your genres. Using simple mode combines like genres into parent genre. For example: Pop Rock would fall under Pop, same with California Pop. The default complex mode will show you all the sub genres. In many cases there is some overlap and this app will tel you how many songs fall under multiple categories.
  
## Illegal Character Replacement (ICRT)
  - Allows the user to scan a directory for illegal characters, default illegal characters are "<>:"/\|?*" the default replacement character is "-" but it can be selected line by line if you want it different for a specific file.
  - For example a song called "l*ve" by default will change to "l-ve" which does not make sense, the ovveride allows you to enter an o in there so it corrects to "love".
