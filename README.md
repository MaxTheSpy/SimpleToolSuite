# SimpleToolSuite

Welcome to SimpleToolsuite, an app built to be lightweight and customizable with simple purpose built plugins. SimpleToolSuite allows you to focus on what matters by providing the tools you want—nothing more, nothing less.

## Whats the big idea?

SimpleToolSuite is designed with a modular approach in mind. Nearly everything is built using plugins which means YOU are in control! Install as few or as many plugins as you want that integrate into your workflow.

## How It Works

1. **Download The Core App:** Start with SimpleToolSuite. This is the foundation, with no plugins included.
2. **Explore Plugins:** Browse for plugins in-app(coming soon) or check out the [Plugin Page on our GitHub Wiki!](https://github.com/MaxTheSpy/SimpleToolSuite/wiki/Available-Plugins)
3. **Install All Or None:** install as many or as few plugins as you need! We've left the customization up to your personal preferences.

## Why SimpleToolSuite?

Many apps try to do far too much, getting endlessly patched and updated as time goes on. While this is great, it often leads to clutter. SimpleToolSuite flips that on its head by letting you build exactly what you need, one tool at a time. No unnessessary features, no distractions. Just a clean Simple Tool Suite that works.
