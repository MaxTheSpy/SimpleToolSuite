Simple Tool Suite or STS is a simple plugin based app launcher for simple apps or scripts.

# App List:

## Simple Music Genre Analyzer (SMGA)

- A simple program where you feed it your music library and it will tell you a percentage based distrobution of your genres. Using simple mode combines like genres into parent genre. For example: Pop Rock would fall under Pop, same with California Pop. The default complex mode will show you all the sub genres. In many cases there is some overlap and this app will tel you how many songs fall under multiple categories.
  
## Illegal Character Replacement (ICRT)

- Allows the user to scan a directory for illegal characters, default illegal characters are "<>:"/\|?*" the default replacement character is "-" but it can be selected line by line if you want it different for a specific file.
- For example a song called "l*ve" by default will change to "l-ve" which does not make sense, the ovveride allows you to enter an o in there so it corrects to "love".

## QR Code Generator (QRCG)

- Create QR codes and embed whatever data you want! The sky is the limit! Embed phone numbers, contact cards, web addresses, wifi network information and more. Select between various QR code sizes, and error correction levels.

## Wifi File Transfer (WIFT)

- WIFT allows you to create your own temporary webpage on your local network that you can upload and download files to. This is helpful for transferring files from your phone to your pc, or other devices on your network.

## Pomodoro Timer (POMO)

- The POMO Plugin is a simple Pomodoro Timer application designed to help users manage their time effectively. The default time selections are backed by decades of research by the Pomodoro Technique Foundation developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s and has been a staple of time management since then. We understand that not everyone conforms or prefers to work on these timelines, so we gave you the ability to change your default times. An added bonus is a small task or note section that you can use to quickly outline what you want to get done before or after your POMO session.
